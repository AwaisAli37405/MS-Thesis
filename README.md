# Multimodal Ant Colony Optimization for Mixed-Variable Optimization Problems

Existing algorithms mostly focus on solving continuous or discrete optimization problems, rather than solving mixed variable optimization problems. This paper focuses on solving multi-modal mixed-variable optimization problems using ant colony optimization algorithm. The solution construction step of the ants in ACO and the structure of the solution archive is modified to construct solutions for mixed decision variables. Furthermore, to achieve multiple optimal solutions clustering method is used for distributing search space into different clusters, which ultimately increases the chances of finding global optimal solutions respectively. The proposed approach needs to find all the optima simultaneously whereas the computational resources are very limited. Therefore, the diversity enhancement operation is introduced in MV − MACO to avoid unnecessary search efforts. Moreover, a detailed analysis is performed on the results obtained with the results of the state of the art techniques and MV − MACO outperforms the mentioned state of the art algorithms under most conditions.
